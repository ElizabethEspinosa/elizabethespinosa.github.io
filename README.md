## About


I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in Complex Systems and Data Science at the University of Vermont (UVM), and a Graduate Research Fellow at the Food Systems Research Institute at UVM. I hold a B.A. in Economics from the Pontifical Catholic University of Ecuador and an M.A. in Development Economics from the Facultad Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales (FLACSO) in Ecuador.<br>

In my doctoral research, I study farmers' climate change resilience behaviors in the U.S., particularly the influence of government programs and climate risks on farmers' climate adaptation responses, in the form of nature-based practices, such as cover crops and crop rotations, and technology implementation, including irrigation and tile drainage systems. My research combines large-scale, time-series, and high-resolution data and applies Bayesian statistical models.

### Climate Change Adaptation through the lens of Farm Size

*Abstract: The heterogeneity of different farmland sizes has been overlooked in the climate adaptation literature, yet it is crucial for identifying effective policy interventions to achieve national-scale climate resilience. Using U.S. Agricultural Census data from 2012, 2017, and 2022 aggregated by farm size groupings within states, we compare the temporal changes in adoption of three water-related climate adaptation practices (cover crops, tile drainage, and irrigation) across small, medium and large farms, individually. Specifically, we provide estimates of the role of multiple government programs and climate changes in shaping heterogeneous climate adaptation behaviors across farm sizes. Applying multilevel models within a Bayesian framework, we show that temporal changes of government programs and climate conditions correlate with temporal changes in adoption differently across farm sizes...*

### Cover Crop Adoption and Disadoption


*Abstract: Despite cover crops been widely promoted for their on and off-farm benefits, their adoption is both low nationally and diminishing in some areas. Existing research has examined a suite of factors affecting the adoption of cover crops in the United States, yet understanding the role of multiple government programs and climate changes has not been fully investigated over time, especially across a national sample. Furthermore, the factors associated with cover crop disadoption have not yet been explored nationally. To fill these gaps in the literature, we combine multiple publicly available data sources to estimate the role of multiple government programs (i.e., crop insurance, state, conservation and working-lands programs) and weather and climate change conditions on county cover crop adoption and disadoption...*
